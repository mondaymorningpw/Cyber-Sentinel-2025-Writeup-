# Cyber-Sentinel-2025-Writeup-

Introduction:
I participated in my first Capture-the-Flag (CTF) event in June 2025. The Cyber Sentinel Skills Challenge, hosted by Correlation One and sponsored by the U.S. The Department of Defense, includes a series of real-world challenges across various cybersecurity categories. Categories include forensics, malware/reverse engineering, networking & reconnaissance, open-source intelligence gathering (OSINT), and web security.
